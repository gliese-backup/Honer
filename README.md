# Concepts

- JSX can't be interpreted by our browser. Vite does the transformation for us
- HMR: Instant Hot Reloads not refresh provided by Vite
- Automatic Semicolon Insertion for this we use `return ();`
- Component is a piece of UI
- Component names must be PascalCase
- It is like a custom Html element
- <h1> native
- <Heading /> is custom component
- how to create: function that return html like syntax called JSX
- JSX has its own rules. Like className instead of just class
- HTML alike syntax inside JS is JSX
- React fragment allows us to nest multiple elements <></>
- {} this is used to go back to JS inside JSX
- Our top level component is generally App
- The role of main.jsx is to start react with react-dom
- To style: We can either give class or style={{}} an object
- Props is the way to get some values inside our components
- Props is an object
- With props we can use object destructuring {property} = object;
- Props can also have default values if we want
